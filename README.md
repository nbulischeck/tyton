## Detection Methodology

**Hidden Modules**: `Sysfs` contains a multitude of ksets which in turn contain multiple kernel objects (kobjects). The kset `module_kset` within `sysfs` holds kobject references to all loaded kernel modules. By traversing this list, we can resolve each kobject back to its containing object (its referenced kernel module). When compared with the current module list entries from `find_module(kobj->mod->name)`, we can uncover modules who unlinked themselves from the list.

**Syscall Table Hooking**: Search through the syscall table to see if any functions point outside the core kernel text section. If they do not point within the core kernel text section, it is likely that they have been hooked but to make sure we search all loaded modules to verify this.

**Network Protocol Hooking**: Grab the `init_net.proc_net` process directory entry and iterate over every subdirectory in the red-black tree looking for subdirectories named `tcp`, `tcp6`, `udp`, `udp6`, `udplite`, and `udplite6`. Once we've acquire the directory entry for the specific network protocol, we can grab the function pointers for `seq_fops` and `seq_ops` - namely we are looking for `seq_fops->llseek`, `seq_fops->read`, `seq_fops->release`, and `seq_ops->show`. In doing this, we can verify that the operation function pointers of network protocols are still inside the core kernel text section and not being manipulated by a kernel module. These are commonly hooked to hide network traffic or exposed ports from netstat and other userland interfaces.

**Netfilter Hooking**: Search through all possible Netfilter hook combinations and report all modules that have active Netfilter hooks. Netfilter hooks have a legitimate use, but it is unlikely that they would be present beyond those made for iptables, ebtables, and friends. They are uncommonly used in LKM rootkits to create backdoors by intercepting packets used to authenticate for port knocking.

**Zeroed Process Inodes**: Search through `/proc` for all `linux_dirent` structures and examine the inodes to find any set to 0. An inode of 0 is typically ignored from directory listings which makes it a good candidate for rootkits to set directories to in order to hide their files.

**Process Fops Hooking**: Open the `/proc` file pointer and check to see if any file operations (namely `iterate`) point outside the core kernel text section.

**Interrupt Descriptor Table Hooking**: Search through the interrupt descriptor table to see if any entries point outside the core kernel text section. If they do not point within the core kernel text section, it is likely that they have been hooked but to make sure we search all loaded modules to verify this.

## Additional Features

**Notifications**: Users (including myself) do not actively monitor their journald logs, so a userland notification daemon has been included to monitor journald logs and display them to the user using libnotify. Notifications are enabled after install by XDG autorun, so if your DM does not have `/etc/xdg/autostart` it will fail.

**DKMS**: Dynamic Kernel Module Support has been added for Arch and Fedora/CentOS (looking to expand in the near future). DKMS allows the (near) seamless upgrading of Kernel modules during kernel upgrades. This is mainly important for distributions that provide rolling releases or upgrade their kernel frequently.

## Installing

### Dependencies

* Linux Kernel 4.4.0-31 or greater
* Corresponding Linux Kernel Headers
* GCC
* Make
* Libnotify
* Libsystemd
* Package Config
* GTK3

### From Source

#### Ubuntu/Debian/Kali

1. `sudo apt install linux-headers-$(uname -r) gcc make libnotify-dev pkg-config libgtk-3-dev libsystemd-dev`
2. `git clone https://github.com/nbulischeck/tyton.git`
3. `cd tyton`
4. `make`
5. `sudo insmod tyton.ko`

> **Note**: For Ubuntu 14.04, libsystemd-dev is named libsystemd-journal-dev.

#### Arch

1. `sudo pacman -S linux-headers gcc make libnotify libsystemd pkgconfig gtk3`
2. `git clone https://github.com/nbulischeck/tyton.git`
3. `cd tyton`
4. `make`
5. `sudo insmod tyton.ko`

##### Kernel Module Arguments

The kernel module can be passed a specific timeout argument on insertion through the command line.

To do this, run the command `sudo insmod tyton.ko timeout=X` where X is the number of minutes you would like the kernel module to wait before executing its scan again.

### AUR

Tyton is available on the AUR [here](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/tyton-dkms-git/).

You can install it using the AUR helper of your choice:

* `yaourt -S tyton-dkms-git`
* `yay -S tyton-dkms-git`
* `pakku -S tyton-dkms-git`
